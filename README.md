Below is a list of commands you will probably find useful.

### `yarn start`

Runs the project in development mode.
You can view your application at `http://localhost:3000`

The page will reload if you make edits.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn start:prod`

Runs the compiled app in production.

You can again view your application at `http://localhost:3000`

### `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher (Jest) in an interactive mode.
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

### `yarn i18n`

Runs the test i18n runner which extracts all the translation strings and
generates the needed files.


### mr_developer

[mr_developer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mr-developer) is a great tool
for developing multiple packages at the same time.

mr_developer should work with this project by using the `--config` config option:

```bash
mrdeveloper --config=jsconfig.json
```

Volto's latest razzle config will pay attention to your jsconfig.json file
for any customizations.
